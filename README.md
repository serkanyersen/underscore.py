This is an update for python3 of: github.com/serkanyersen/underscore.py.git

Underscore.py is a python port of excellent javascript library underscore.js

**What is underscore.js?**

    From underscore page: Underscore.js is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides support for the
    usual functional suspects (each, map, reduce, filter...) without extending any core JavaScript objects.

NOTE: It's obvious that python already has nearly all features of underscore library built-in. I'm not trying to fill any gap in python. If you are coming from JavaScript this library will provide you a familiar interface, a set of tools you already know how to use and micro templating functionality. Use it wisely and try to use built-in functions wherever possible.

## Installing

Install from pypi
```bash
pip install underscore.py
```
**or**

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git://github.com/serkanyersen/underscore.py.git
```
Get into underscore.py directory
```bash
cd underscore.py
```
Run setup script
```bash
sudo python setup.py install
```
That's it

## Usage
Import underscore to your project
```python
from underscore import _
```
or if you don't want to mess with _ variable
```python
from underscore import _ as us  # You can use any name you want, __ or u
```

## Use it just like javascript version
```python
# Dynamically
_(["foo", "bar"]).invoke("upper")  # ["FOO", "BAR"]
# or statically
_.filter(["foo", "hello", "bar", "world"], lambda x, *a: len(x) > 3)  # ["hello", "world"]
# Do chaining
_([10, 48, 56, 30, 20]).chain().filter(lambda x, *a: x > 20).map(lambda x, *a: x * 2).sortBy().value()
# [60, 96, 112]
```

## Full micro templating support
```python
tmpl = _.template("Name: <% if prefix: %><%= prefix %>. <% endif %><%= name %>\n\
Last Name: <%=lname.upper() %>\n\
<% if email: %>\
E-mail: <%= email %>\n\
<% endif %>")

people = [{
  "prefix": "",
  "name": "John",
  "lname": "Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
},{
  "prefix": "Mr",
  "name": "James",
  "lname": "Brown",
  "email": "james@brown.net"
}]

for person in people:
  print tmpl(person)
```
Output

    Name: John
    Last Name: DOE
    E-mail: johndoe@example.com
    Name: Mr. James
    Last Name: BROWN
    E-mail: james@brown.net

### Disclaimer
Please keep in mind that this is a direct port of a javascript library, so don't get started with
the "but it's not pythonic" stuff. This library has no intentions to be pythonic, infact it tries to
bring the same underscore experience from javascript to python
